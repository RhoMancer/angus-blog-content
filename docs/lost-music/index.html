      <h1>How I found and lost a love for music</h1>
<p>I played the drums and guitar when I was younger. For me, it’s been years since I played both. In elementary school I
played trombone and I sang, but eventually those lost their appeal. It wasn’t until the games Guitar Hero &amp; Rock Band
did I really get into the hype of playing. Rock music had a much richer history than the grunge and alternative I was
raised on, and was suddenly obsessed with playing real guitar and drum whenever I could.</p>
<p>Rock Band was the real launching off for me. In 2007, I didn’t have a Facebook, MySpace, or a cell phone, but I did have
a PS3. How do kids these days get into hobbies? Do they see something on their TikTok and decide, “that’s cool; that’s
for me” or do they just keep scrolling? Rock Band and Guitar Hero were there for me, a kid who considered himself
artistically talentless, as an inlet for creative exploration.</p>
<p>On real rock instruments, I got my start on drums playing on my buddy Rob from middle schools’ set. There was a heatwave
one summer, and I spent 3 nights at his house as we beat all of Guitar Hero 3 co-op. It was the days. Over the following
month, I transferred my skills from Rock Band drums to real drums, practicing when we could. Rob and I recruited some
other dudes from school to play with us, and our ninth graders’ first rock band was born. I was the singer, we
covered Green Day, Weezer; and I’ll admit I was hooked to the amount of attention I was getting.</p>
<p>I joined more bands, recorded albums and EPs, studied Music Theory in college, was the lead of the chorale and the
school musical (granted, my school was tiny), and made lots of friends and connections. Then, one day, a tipping
point happened: and from then on it was all about how I will make an income, go to college, have a career, save for
retirement, stay current in my field, not get fired, and get promoted; Music in my life died a brief and unironically
quiet death. I tried to hang onto guitar skills through college, but beyond drunken singalongs and convincing a girl
I was not a total stick in the mud, it was pointless. I tried again during the pandemic but never got the hook to
stick to it. As always, my speed of improvement was dishearteningly slow, and other priorities got in the way. As for
drums, I haven’t given any an honest play in 15 years.</p>
<p>Now, the guitar sitting in the corner stays dusty, unplayed, and perhaps even sadder than I am about its state. “I gave
Music up for my survival, my future,” I tell myself, half believing it, a tear in my eye, and coping in my words. The
silence and absence are still real, but not every passion can survive adulthood. Maybe the reality is that I never
really
had anything worth pursuing and was doomed to be let down from the start. Perhaps what I thought was improvement and
impression was all just stage lights and amp feedback pushing adrenaline and dopamine.</p>
<p>…but ultimately, I am grateful that I could be inspired. This gratitude did not come easy, but because I had to look
for it. I’m grateful that some campy video games with crude facsimiles of music instruments could make me fall in love
with so many sounds, histories, and cultures. I’ll probably never be satisfied with this part of my personal history,
but I can’t deny that love I’ve had since I first started learning. That is the romantic part of my personal musical
tragedy: that it existed, at all, in the context of everything else.</p>
